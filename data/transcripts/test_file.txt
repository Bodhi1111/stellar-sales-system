[00:00:05] Sales Pro: Hello, thanks for joining the call today.
[00:00:10] Client: Hi, thanks for having me. I'm interested in learning about trusts.
[00:00:15] Sales Pro: Great. We'll cover that. The main goal is to discuss your estate and see if a trust is a good fit.
[00:25:10] Client: This all sounds good, but the price seems a bit high.
[00:25:20] Sales Pro: I understand. Let's talk about the value and what's included.
[00:28:45] Client: Okay, let's schedule a follow-up meeting for next week.
