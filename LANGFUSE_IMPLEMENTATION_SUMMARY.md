## How to Get Started

### 1. Start LangFuse Server

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.langfuse.yml up -d
```

### 2. Create Account & API Keys

1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Create account
3. Go to Settings â†’ API Keys
4. Create new API key pair

### 3. Configure Environment

Add to `.env`:
```bash
LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY=pk-lf-your-key-here
LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY=sk-lf-your-secret-here
LANGFUSE_HOST=http://localhost:3000
```

### 4. Verify Setup

```bash
python scripts/test_langfuse_complete.py
```

### 5. Run Demo

```bash
python scripts/demo_langfuse_pipeline.py
```

### 6. View Results

Open http://localhost:3000/traces

## What You Can Do Now

### Monitor Pipeline Execution
- See complete visual timeline of agent execution
- Identify which agents are slowest
- Track data flow between agents

### Debug Issues
- View full stack traces for errors
- See exact input that caused failure
- Understand where pipeline stops

### Optimize Performance
- Compare execution times across runs
- Find bottlenecks easily
- Measure impact of code changes

### Track LLM Usage
- Monitor token consumption
- See all prompts sent to model
- Calculate costs per transcript

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `docs/LANGFUSE_SETUP.md` | First-time setup instructions |
| `docs/LANGFUSE_USAGE_GUIDE.md` | How to use and interpret traces |
| `docs/LANGFUSE_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` | Solutions to common problems |

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Complete diagnostic test
python scripts/test_langfuse_complete.py

# Interactive demo
python scripts/demo_langfuse_pipeline.py

# Run pipeline with full tracing
python orchestrator/pipeline_langfuse_enhanced.py
```

## Architecture

### Trace Hierarchy

```
ðŸ“Š Trace (Complete Pipeline Run)
  â””â”€ ðŸ“¦ Span (Individual Agent)
      â”œâ”€ Input Data
      â”œâ”€ Output Data
      â”œâ”€ Metadata (timing, metrics)
      â””â”€ ðŸ’¬ Generation (LLM Call)
          â”œâ”€ Prompt
          â”œâ”€ Response
          â””â”€ Token Usage
```

### Data Flow

```
1. Pipeline starts â†’ Creates Trace in LangFuse
2. Each agent runs â†’ Creates Span under Trace
3. Agent calls LLM â†’ Creates Generation under Span
4. Pipeline ends â†’ Finalizes Trace with summary
5. View in UI â†’ Complete visualization available
```

---

## Performance Impact

**Overhead:** ~10-15% slower with full tracing enabled

**Why?**
- Capturing and serializing data
- Network calls to LangFuse server
- Trace buffer flushing

**Recommendation:** Use for development and debugging, not production

---

## Future Enhancements

Ready to implement when needed:

1. **Reasoning Engine Tracing**
   - Apply same pattern to reasoning workflow
   - Trace planner, tool executor, auditor, strategist

2. **Custom Metrics**
   - Add domain-specific metrics (deal value, client type, etc.)
   - Create custom dashboards

3. **Alerting**
   - Set up alerts for errors or slow agents
   - Email notifications for failures

4. **Cost Tracking**
   - Calculate costs per transcript
   - Track budget usage over time

## Troubleshooting Quick Reference

| Issue | Quick Fix |
|-------|-----------|
| Can't access UI | `docker ps` - check containers running |
| 401 Unauthorized | Regenerate API keys in UI, update .env |
| No traces appearing | Check `.flush()` is called, refresh browser |
| Port 3000 in use | Change port in docker-compose.langfuse.yml |
| Slow performance | Normal - 10-15% overhead expected |
