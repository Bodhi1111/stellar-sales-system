## 🎯 Overall Assessment

### ✅ What's Working Perfectly

1. **Header Extraction**: 100% accuracy on all 8 fields
2. **Pattern Detection**: Correctly identified Pattern B header format
3. **CRM Integration**: Meeting title successfully added to CRM record
4. **Data Prioritization**: Header metadata used instead of LLM extraction (fast + accurate)
5. **Multi-table Sync**: All 5 Baserow tables populated correctly
6. **Content Quality**: Email drafts, social posts, and coaching all high quality
7. **Transcript Summary**: Accurate and concise

### ⚠️ Issues Found

1. **Email Field Mapping**:
   - **Issue**: `client_email` column in Baserow is empty despite being in crm_json
   - **Root Cause**: Baserow field mapping warning during sync: "Warning: Field 'email' not found in Baserow schema"
   - **Impact**: Medium - email is stored in crm_json but not in dedicated column
   - **Fix Required**: Update Baserow field mapper to use correct field name (likely `client_email` vs `email`)

2. **Filename Field**:
   - **Issue**: `transcript_filename` showing "unknown.txt" instead of actual filename
   - **Impact**: Low - transcript_id is correct
   - **Fix**: Pass actual filename through pipeline
