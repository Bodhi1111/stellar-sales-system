## ‚ùì FAQ

### Q: How accurate is the 50% ‚Üí 85% estimate?
**A**: Conservative estimate based on:
- Semantic NLP: Documented to improve accuracy by enabling intent/sentiment filtering
- Re-ranking: Research shows 10-15% improvement in retrieval precision
- Semantic chunking: Preserves context, reduces fragmentation errors
- Combined effect: 35-45% improvement is realistic

### Q: Why haven't these features been enabled already?
**A**: They were designed but not activated. This is common in iterative development - build the architecture first, then enable features incrementally. You're at that activation stage now.

### Q: What's the risk of implementing these changes?
**A**: Low risk because:
- Most changes are configuration-based
- Code for semantic NLP and chunking already exists
- Features can be disabled with simple flags
- Comprehensive testing scripts provided
- Rollback plan documented

### Q: How long to see results?
**A**: 
- Week 1: Semantic NLP + chunking active, see +20-30% improvement
- Week 2: Re-ranking added, see additional +10% improvement
- Total: 1-2 weeks to 75-85% accuracy

### Q: What happens after Phase 1?
**A**: Phase 2 focuses on infrastructure (logging, caching, query expansion) and Phase 3 on advanced features (feedback loops, self-improvement). But Phase 1 alone gets you to production-ready accuracy.
